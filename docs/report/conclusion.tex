\chapter{Conclusion}
\section{Remarks}
Undertaking this project has enabled us to explore the extensive research
conducted in the field \textit{image compression}. We established an
understanding of the famous \textit{Discrete Wavelet Transform} and it's
immediate application in the Embedded Zerotree Wavelet Algorithm. We also
discovered the various aspects such as encoding schemes and quantization
methods that govern the EZW algorithm output.

\section{Proposed outcomes}
A fully operative EZW coder, with data to support claims made earlier.

\section{Future work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A multi-core implementation of the algorithm
    \item An FPGA-based hardware accelerator for the algorithm
\end{itemize}
