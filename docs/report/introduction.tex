\section{Overview}
\label{sec:overview}

The project aims to implement the \textbf{Embedded Zerotree Wavelet} algorithm
as a C library. It employs the well known \textit{Discrete Wavelet Transform}
as a tool for compression. The algorithm will be studied under several
operating conditions and demands, such as varying levels of
compression,``bit-budget'', etc

\subsubsection{The Basics}%
\label{sec:the_basics}

\textit{Data compression} is the science of representing any given information
in a compact form. A \textit{compression algorithm} by itself, refers to two
separate algorithms. \textit{A compression algorithm} (takes $\alpha$ and
generates $\alpha_c$) and a \textit {reconstruction algorithm} (takes
$\alpha_c$ generates $\alpha$ or an approximation of $\alpha$), where $\alpha$
is a symbol. The compression technique is said to be \textit{lossless} if the
reconstructed symbols are identical to the original symbols and it is said to
be \textit{lossy} if the  reconstructed symbols are not identical to the
original symbols.

A step-wise approach towards implementing this algorithm is taken, wherein
the each step is represented by a block in figure \ref{fig:tcoder}.

\subsection{The transformer}
\label{sec:the_transformer}

The transformer performs a mathematical transform on the supplied image. The
transform must satisfy 2 key properties, namely:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Full invertibility
    \item Separability
\end{itemize}

A few transforms that satisfy these conditions are the Fourier transform, the
discrete cosine transform and the wavelet transform. Wavelet transform is used
in this case, since it provides all the tools for performing multi-resolution
analysis.

\subsubsection{Wavelets}%
\label{sec:theory_of_wavelets}

To overcome the shortcomings of traditional transforms such as the Discrete
Fourier Transform (DFT), Discrete Cosine Transform (DFT), Short Time Fourier
Fourier Transform (STFT), and Gabor Transform, the need for \textit{wavelets}
arised. The fourier analysis provides key information in the frequency domain
while fails to provide any information regarding the time domain.  The STFT and
the Gabor Transform (STFT with Gaussian window function) provide concurrent
information about both time and frequency, but the window size is immutable.
Essentially, it is not possible to infer the exact frequency and the exact time
of occurence of that frequency in the signal.

\par

The reason that wavelets are preferred for image analysis is due to the fact
that it provides a hierarchical grading of the time and frequency information.
The fact that low frequency information exists for a longer period of time and
the high frequency information changes rapidly with time is exploited in
wavelet analysis. In the case of image analysis, \textit{time} is equivalent to
\textit{spacial area}. The phrase \textit{low frequency components exist in
larger spacial area} indicates that the pixel values in that region donot
change significantly. Similarly, \textit{high frequency components} refers to
the finer details which change rapidly in space.  Higher temporal accuracy is
required to observe the high frequency components and vice-versa.

\par

Performing wavelet analysis by utilizing a scalable and modulated window to
calculate the spectrum repeatedly provides the necessary collection of
time-frequency representations of the signal. In this context, decreasing the
scale is equivalent to focusing on higher detail. \textit{Scaling} refers to
increasing or decreasing the size of a portion of the signal by a factor and
\textit{translation} refers to shifting a signal towards the right or the left.
The basis function which scales and translates to analyze other signals and
generate wavelets is called as the \textit{mother wavelet}.

\par

There are numerous choices of wavelets that are available, for example, the
\textit{haar, daubechies, coiflet, gaussian, etc} for performing wavelet
analysis of images.

\subsubsection{The Wavelet Transform}%
\label{sec:the_wavelet_transform}

The \textit{Continuous Wavelet Transform} (CWT) is mathematically represented
by the equation given below.

\[\gamma(s, \tau) = \int f(t)\cdot\psi^{*}_{s, \tau}(t)dt\]

\(f(t)\) is the signal to be decomposed into a set of basis functions
\(\psi_{s,\tau}(t)\) called the \textit{wavelets}. The new variables \(s\) and
$\tau$ are the scale and translation respectively. The wavelets generated by
scaling and translating the mother wavelet can now be mathematically
represented as

$$\psi_{s,\tau}(t)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{s}}\cdot\psi \left (\frac{t-\tau}{s} \right)$$

The mother wavelet is scaled and translated to realize more orthogonal
wavelets.  The issue with the CWT is that it brings in redundancy, and it's
computation is time consuming.  To address these issues, the \textit{Discrete
Wavelet Transform} was developed, which computes the transforms at various
discrete samples.

Mathematically,

$$\psi_{j,k}(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{s_{0}^j}} \cdot \psi \left (\frac{t - k \tau_{0}s_{0}^j}{s_{0}^j} \right )$$

The wavelet transform is computed by calculating the inner product of the
function with a wavelet (mother wavelet after scaling and translating).  An
important aspect here is that the DWT is not discrete in time, but the scale
and translation parameters are incremented/decremented in steps
\cite{valwav1999}.  Further, it can be proved that implementing the wavelet
transform as an iterative digital filter bank enables the subsampling property.
This means that the signal is decomposed using filter banks, downsampled,
quantized and encoded.

\par

Applying the DWT on the images is equivalent to dividing the image into four
different \textit{subbands}. That is to say that, the wavelet based coding
divides the image into hierarchical subbands critically subsampled. Each
subband contains the wavelet coefficients and these coefficients interestingly
represent a spacial area in the higher levels of subbands.

    \label{fig:subband1}
\end{figure}

\pagebreak

These four subbands are created by applying the digital filters in both the
horizontal and vertical directions.
\begin{itemize}
    \item LL Subband: Realized by low pass filtering the image in both
        horizontal and vertical directions.
    \item HL Subband: Realized by high pass filtering the image in horizontal
        direction low pass filtering in vertical direction.
    \item LH Subband: Realized by low pass filtering the image in horizontal
        direction high pass filtering in vertical direction.
    \item LL Subband: Realized by high pass filtering the image in both
        horizontal and vertical directions.
\end{itemize}

These subbands are successively quantized for further compression. It is
important to note that every subband consists one-fourth of the total samples
of a certain level of decomposition.  This process of successively decomposing
the LL subband for image analysis is known as \textit{dyadic partitioning}.
Each of the subimages obatined in this manner can be filtered and subsampled
until the desired subband structure is obtained.

\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier

It is to be noted that when images are decomposed in this manner, most of the
information or the energy is concentrated in the lower subband (mostly LL
subband), which confirms that low frequency components contain the maximum
information of that spacial area.  Generally the LL subband is a low resolution
and inexpensive approximation of the original image, while the other subbands
contain the finer details (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) that can be
added.

\subsection{The quantizer}
\label{sec:the_quantizer}

The wavelet transformed coefficients are to be quantized to produce the
\textit{bitstream}.  All information loss happens during the quantization
stage.  The coefficients are passed through a midtread quantizer to obtain the
initial reconstructed value of the coefficient, which is $\pm 1.5$ times the
initial threshold value.  To achieve higher precision of reconstructed values,
refinement is done by encoding the quantized difference value of the
coefficient and it's reconstructed value and using it for final reconstruction.
